# Road Tripper

Born from a love of travel and the open road, Road Tripper is a full stack web application that takes a user's starting and ending location, builds a drive route, and suggests park and restaurant stops along the path. Users can see the Yelp rating for each roadside attraction through the app results, and follow links directly to the location's Yelp review page. Bay Area users also have an option to view suggestions using a D3 map. Finally, any user may save road trip searches for later adventures.
